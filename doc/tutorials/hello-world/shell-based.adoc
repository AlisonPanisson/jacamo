= Creating JaCaMo projects in the shell command
for unix users

. Download JaCaMo https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacamo/files/version-0[here] and unzip it.

. Make sure you have `JACAMO_HOME` properly set (it should have the directories `libs` and `scripts` inside), then setup the `PATH`:

    export PATH=$JACAMO_HOME/scripts:$PATH

. Create a new project with
+
----
new-jacamo-project ../somewhere/helloworld
----
Examples of agent, artifact and organization are placed in the `src` folder.


. And run it with
+
    jacamo ../somewhere/helloworld/helloworld.jcm
+
If you have Gradle installed, you can also run the application with
+
    cd ../somewhere/helloworld
    gradle
