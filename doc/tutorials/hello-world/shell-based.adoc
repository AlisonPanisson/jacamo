= Creating JaCaMo projects in the shell command
for unix users

. Download JaCaMo https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacamo/files/version-0[here] and unzip it.

. Make sure you have `JACAMO_HOME` properly set (it should have the directories `libs` and `scripts` inside), then setup the `PATH`:

    export PATH=$JACAMO_HOME/scripts:$PATH

. Create a new project with
+
----
    new-jacamo-project ../somewhere/myproject
----
Examples of agent, artifact and organization are placed in the `src` folder.


. And run it with

    jacamo ../somewhere/myproject.jcm
