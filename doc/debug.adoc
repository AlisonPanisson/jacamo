How to setup verbosity of an agent?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The verbosity is set in the options defined for the agent in the project
file. For instance

---------------------------
   ...
   agents: ag1 [verbose=2];
   ...
---------------------------

A number between 0 and 2 should be specified. The higher the number, the
more information about that agent is printed out in the Jason console.
The default is in fact 1, not 0; verbose 1 prints out only the actions
that agents perform in the environment and the messages exchanged
between them. Verbose 2 is for debugging (it corresponds to the java log
level FINE).

=== How to log the overall execution?

Jason uses the http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/logging/overview.html[Java logging API] to output messages into the console (the default console is
called MASConsole). To change the log level or device, select the menu
Plugins -> Jason -> Edit Log properties in the jEdit plugin. If you
are not using jEdit, you can copy the default configuration file from https://github.com/jason-lang/jason/blob/master/src/main/resources/templates/logging.properties[here] to your
application directory. The default configuration file has comments that
helps you customise your log. For instance, to output messages both into
an XML file and in the console, you only need to set the log handler as
in the following line:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler, java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get only console output (without the MASConsole GUI):

-------------------------------------------
handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
-------------------------------------------

[[how-to-log-agents-mind-states]]
How to log agentsâ€™ mind states?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Besides running the system in debug mode, we can define options for an
agent such that the current state of its mind is shown or stored in
files.

To show the current mind state in the screen, add the following option
in the project:

---------------------------------------------
agents:
       bob [mindinspector="gui(cycle,html)"];
---------------------------------------------

In this case the screen is updated each reasoning cycle. If you want to
store all the states in a kind of _history_, add a third argument as
in the example below.

----------------------------------------------------
      bob [mindinspector="gui(cycle,html,history)"];
----------------------------------------------------

In the place of _cycle_, you can write the refresh interval in
mili-seconds:

---------------------------------------------------
      bob [mindinspector="gui(2000,html,history)"];
---------------------------------------------------

You can also see the history of minds in a browser with the following
configuration:

----------------------------------------------------
      bob [mindinspector="web(cycle,html,history)"];
----------------------------------------------------

The URL is typically http://locaslhost:3272.

To store the history of minds in files, use the following configuration:

------------------------------------------------
      bob [mindinspector="file(cycle,xml,log)"];
------------------------------------------------

The last parameter is the name of the directory where files will be
stored. Each file corresponds to a sample of the mind. They are XML
files with suitable style sheets to be viewed in browsers.

== Infrastructures

=== What are infrastructures for?

An infrastructure provides the following services for the MAS:

* communication (e.g., the centralised infrastructure implements
communication based on KQML whilst JADE implements it using FIPA-ACL),
* control of the agent life cycle (creation, running, destruction).

=== Which infrastructures are available?

The current distribution has the following infrastructures:

Centralised:::
  this infrastructure runs all agents in the same host. It provides fast
  startup and high performance for systems that can be executed in a
  single computer. It is also useful to test and develop (prototype)
  systems. Centralised is the default infrastructure.
Jade:::
  provides distribution and communication using http://jade.tilab.com[Jade],
  which is based on FIPA-ACL. With this infrastructure, all tools
  available with JADE (e.g., Sniffer and Inspector) are also available to
  monitor and inspect agents.
  +
Since Jason agents use KQML and JADE uses FIPA-ACL, we opted to translate the
  messages from KQML to FIPA-ACL and vice-versa to maintain the
  AgentSpeak programming the same for all infrastructures. The following
  table summarises the translation of the basic performatives:
+
[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=================
|FIPA-ACL |KQML
|inform |tell
|query-ref |askOne
|request |achieve
|=================
+
You can find more information about this infrastructure in the http://jason.sourceforge.net/mini-tutorial/jason-jade[Jason-JADE tutorial].


=== How to select an infrastructure?

In the `.mas2j` project file, use the `infrastructure` entry to select
an infrastructure, for example to use Centralised:

-------------------------------
MAS auction {
    infrastructure: Centralised
    agents: ag1; ag2; ag3;
}
-------------------------------

and to use Jade:

---------------------------
MAS auction {
    infrastructure: Jade
    agents: ag1; ag2; ag3;
}
---------------------------

Note that the agents do not need to be changed for different
infrastructures. The Jason Agent Architecture binds them to the available
infrastructure.
